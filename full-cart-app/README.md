This project is actually a front-end application which uses a fakestore API to retrieve the data and builds an online
e-commerce application, where we can view the products available, can add then to the cart and play with Quantity values.

Still need to be improved, posting this in github for various reasons, mainly having no time to complete a prestegious assignment.

Need to add Login page, And Hook up an API and add POST, PUT DELETE rotues to it and integrate them to add, remove, update products, add an end point to checkout button as well.

Will upload the new version very shortly.
